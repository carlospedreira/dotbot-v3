# dotbot v3 - Autonomous Development Framework

A project-agnostic framework for autonomous software development using Claude Code. Provides task management, two-phase execution (analysis + implementation), per-task git worktree isolation, a web dashboard, and a PowerShell MCP server.

## Installation

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/andresharpe/dotbot-v3 dotbot-install
cd dotbot-install
pwsh install.ps1
```

The installer copies the `.bot/` framework into your project and configures Claude Code integration (agents, skills, and MCP server).

### Post-Install Verification

After installation, confirm the setup:

```bash
# Agents and skills should be in .claude/
ls .claude/agents/    # implementer, planner, reviewer, tester
ls .claude/skills/    # create-migration, entity-design, etc.

# MCP config should reference dotbot
cat .mcp.json         # dotbot, context7, playwright servers

# Launch the dashboard
pwsh .bot/go.ps1      # Opens http://localhost:8686
```

## How It Works

### Two-Phase Task Execution

Every task goes through two phases, each run by a separate Claude instance:

**Phase 1 - Analysis** (`98-analyse-task.md`):
- Identifies affected entities and files
- Maps applicable coding standards
- Validates dependencies
- Produces concrete implementation guidance (insertion points, pattern snippets, field mappings)
- Asks clarifying questions or proposes task splits if needed

**Phase 2 - Execution** (`99-autonomous-task.md`):
- Receives pre-packaged analysis context (no re-exploration needed)
- Implements changes following the analysis guidance
- Runs verification scripts (privacy scan, git clean, build, format)
- Commits with task ID references

### Per-Task Git Worktrees

Each task runs in an isolated git worktree:

```
Analysis picks up task
  → Creates branch: task/{short-id}-{slug}
  → Creates worktree: ../worktrees/{repo}/task-{short-id}-{slug}/
  → Sets up junctions for shared .bot/ directories
  → Copies essential gitignored files (e.g., .env)

Execution picks up analysed task
  → Looks up existing worktree
  → Claude implements and commits to task branch

On completion
  → Rebases task branch onto main
  → Squash-merges to main
  → Cleans up worktree and branch
```

This provides full isolation between tasks — a failed task never leaves dirty state in the main working tree.

### Task Lifecycle

```
todo → analysing → analysed → in-progress → done
         │                                     │
         ├→ needs-input (question/split)        └→ squash-merged to main
         └→ skipped (non-recoverable)
```

### Process Launcher

`launch-process.ps1` is the unified entry point for all Claude invocations. It supports multiple process types:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `analysis` | Pre-flight task analysis |
| `execution` | Task implementation |
| `kickstart` | Product planning and task creation |
| `planning` | Roadmap generation |
| `commit` | Git operations |
| `task-creation` | Bulk task creation |

Each process gets a registry entry for tracking and is managed through the web dashboard.

### MCP Server

The PowerShell MCP server (`dotbot-mcp.ps1`) exposes 30+ tools to Claude via stdio transport:

- **Task tools**: create, list, get-next, mark-in-progress, mark-done, mark-skipped, etc.
- **Session tools**: initialize, update, get-state, get-stats
- **Plan tools**: create, get, update
- **Dev tools**: start, stop, deploy, logs, release
- **Steering**: heartbeat with whisper channel for operator interrupts

Tools are auto-discovered from `.bot/systems/mcp/tools/{tool-name}/` — each tool is a folder with `metadata.yaml` (schema) and `script.ps1` (implementation).

## Usage

### Launch the Dashboard

```bash
pwsh .bot/go.ps1
```

Opens the web UI at `http://localhost:8686` where you can:
- View and manage tasks
- Start analysis and execution processes
- Monitor running processes
- Kick off product planning

### Product Planning

From the dashboard, use the kickstart workflow to:
1. Define product mission and tech stack
2. Generate task groups from the roadmap
3. Expand groups into individual tasks with acceptance criteria

### Autonomous Execution

Start analysis and execution processes from the dashboard. They run in a loop:

1. **Analysis process** picks up `todo` tasks, analyses them, marks them `analysed`
2. **Execution process** picks up `analysed` tasks, implements them, marks them `done`
3. Completed tasks are squash-merged to main automatically

### Manual Task Management

Use MCP tools directly in Claude Code:

```
task_create       → Create a new task
task_list         → List tasks by status/category/priority
task_get_next     → Get highest priority ready task
task_get_stats    → View completion statistics
```

## Agents

Four TDD-focused agent personas in `.claude/agents/`:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **implementer** | Writes production code to make tests pass |
| **planner** | Creates roadmaps and breaks down work |
| **reviewer** | Reviews code quality and patterns |
| **tester** | Writes failing tests first (TDD) |

## Verification Hooks

Pre-commit and post-task verification scripts in `.bot/hooks/verify/`:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `00-privacy-scan.ps1` | Detect absolute paths and secrets |
| `01-git-clean.ps1` | Ensure no uncommitted changes |
| `02-git-pushed.ps1` | Check for unpushed commits (skipped for task branches) |

Additional project-specific hooks (dotnet build, dotnet format) can be added.

## Configuration

- **`.mcp.json`** — MCP server configuration (dotbot, context7, playwright)
- **`.bot/defaults/settings.default.json`** — Default framework settings
- **`.bot/defaults/theme.default.json`** — Dashboard theme
- **`.bot/.control/`** — Runtime state (process registry, worktree map, settings) — gitignored

## TODO

- [ ] Create `.bot/setup.ps1` bootstrap script to install tooling dependencies (gitleaks, etc.) and configure git hooks
- [ ] Move pre-commit hook template to `.bot/hooks/git/pre-commit` so it can be installed by setup script
